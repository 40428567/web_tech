            He hadn't gone far when he met a funny-looking, old man who said to him, "Good morning, Jack."
            "Good morning to you," said Jack, wondering how the little, old man knew his name.
            "Where are you off to this fine morning?" asked the man.
            "I'm going to market to sell our cow, Bessy."
            "Well what a helpful son you are!" exclaimed the man, "I have a special deal for such a good boy like you."
            <p>The little, old man looked around to make sure no one was watching and then opened his hand to show Jack what he held.</p>
            "Beans?" asked Jack, looking a little confused.
            "Three magical bean seeds to be exact, young man.  One, two, three!  So magical are they, that if you plant them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky," promised the funny little man.  "And because you're such a good boy, they're all yours in trade for that old milking cow."
            "Really?" said Jack, "and you're quite sure they're magical?"
            "I am indeed!  And if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have your cow back."
            "Well that sounds fair," said Jack, as he handed over Bessy's halter, pocketed the beans and headed back home to show his mother.                
            </p>
            <p>
            "Back already, Jack?" asked his mother; "I see you haven't got Old Bess -- you've sold her so quickly.  How much did you get for her?"
            Jack smiled and reached into his pocket, "Just look at these beans, mother; they're magical, plant them over-night and----"
            "What!?" cried Jack's mother.  "Oh, silly boy!  How could you give away our milking cow for three measly beans?"
            </p>
            <p>And with that she did the worst thing Jack had ever seen her do - she burst into tears.</p>
