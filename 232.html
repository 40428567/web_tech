                <p>The moment when Jack was turned into a stump was seen by a good fairy. She realised that Jack was not a bad person, he just desperately wanted to help his mother. The fairies felt sorry for Jack. She waited for the old man to walk away and turned Jack and the cow back into their bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                Jack was very happy and promised the fairy never to be rude to people again. The good fairy was pleased with Jack and gave him a magic harp and a chicken that laying golden eggs.
