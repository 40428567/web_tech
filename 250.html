                And when he got there he found a long, broad road winding its way through the clouds to a tall, square castle off in the distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jack ran up the road toward the castle and just as he reached it, the door swung open to reveal a horrible lady giant, with one great eye in the middle of her forehead. As soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, and dragged him into the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't be in such a hurry, I'm sure a growing boy like you would like a nice, big breakfast," said the great, big, tall woman, "It's been so long since I got to make breakfast for a boy."
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, the lady giant wasn't such a bad sort, after all — even if she was a bit odd.  She took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a chunk of cheese and a glass of milk.  But Jack had only taken a few bites when thump! thump! thump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Goodness gracious me!  It's my husband," said the giant woman, wringing her hands, "what on earth shall I do?  There's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast and I haven't any bread left.  Oh dear, I never should have let you stay for breakfast.  Here, come quick and jump in here."  And she hurried Jack into a large copper pot sitting beside the stove just as her husband, the giant, came in. He ducked inside the kitchen and said, "I'm ready for my breakfast — I'm so hungry I could eat three cows.  Ah, what's this I smell?
            </p>
                Fee-fi-fo-fum, <br>
                I smell the blood of an Englishman,<br>
                Be he alive, or be he dead <br>
                I'll have his bones to grind my bread. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nonsense, dear," said his wife, "we haven't had a boy for breakfast in years.  Now you go and wash up and by the time you come back your breakfast will be ready for you."
            </p>
            <p>
                So the giant went off to tidy up — Jack was about to make a run for it when the woman stopped him.  "Wait until he's asleep," she said, "he always has a little snooze after breakfast."
